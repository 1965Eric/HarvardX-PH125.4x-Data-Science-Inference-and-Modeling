After completing Section 1, you will be able to: Understand how to use a sampling model to perform a poll. Explain the terms population, parameter, and sample as they relate to statistical inference. Use a sample to estimate the population proportion from the sample average. Calculate the expected value and standard error of the sample average. 2.1 Sampling Model Parameters and Estimates The textbook for this section is available here and here; first part Key points The task of statistical inference is to estimate an unknown population parameter using observed data from a sample. In a sampling model, the collection of elements in the urn is called the population. A parameter is a number that summarizes data for an entire population. A sample is observed data from a subset of the population. An estimate is a summary of the observed data about a parameter that we believe is informative. It is a data-driven guess of the population parameter. We want to predict the proportion of the blue beads in the urn, the parameter \\(p\\) . The proportion of red beads in the urn is \\(1 - p\\) and the spread is \\(2p - 1\\). The sample proportion is a random variable. Sampling gives random results drawn from the population distribution. Code: Function for taking a random draw from a specific urn The dslabs package includes a function for taking a random draw of size \\(n\\) from the urn: if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) if(!require(dslabs)) install.packages(&quot;dslabs&quot;) library(tidyverse) library(dslabs) take_poll(25) # draw 25 beads 2.2 The Sample Average The textbook for this section is available here and here Key points Many common data science tasks can be framed as estimating a parameter from a sample. We illustrate statistical inference by walking through the process to estimate \\(p\\). From the estimate of \\(p\\), we can easily calculate an estimate of the spread, \\(2p - 1\\). Consider the random variable \\(X\\) that is 1 if a blue bead is chosen and 0 if a red bead is chosen. The proportion of blue beads in \\(N\\) draws is the average of the draws \\(X_1,...,X_N\\). \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample average. In statistics, a bar on top of a symbol denotes the average. \\(\\bar{X}\\) is a random variable because it is the average of random draws - each time we take a sample, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is different. \\(\\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1+X_2+...+X_N}{N}\\) The number of blue beads drawn in N draws, \\(N\\bar{X}\\), is \\(N\\) times the proportion of values in the urn. However, we do not know the true proportion: we are trying to estimate this parameter \\(p\\). 2.3 Polling versus Forecasting The textbook for this section is available here Key points A poll taken in advance of an election estimates \\(p\\) for that moment, not for election day. In order to predict election results, forecasters try to use early estimates of \\(p\\) to predict \\(p\\) on election day. We discuss some approaches in later sections. 2.4 Properties of Our Estimate The textbook for this section is available here Key points When interpreting values of \\(\\bar{X}\\), it is important to remember that \\(\\bar{X}\\) is a random variable with an expected value and standard error that represents the sample proportion of positive events. The expected value of \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the parameter of interest \\(p\\). This follows from the fact that \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sum of independent draws of a random variable times a constant \\(1/N\\). \\(\\mbox{E}(\\bar{X}) = p\\) As the number of draws \\(N\\) increases, the standard error of our estimate \\(\\bar{X}\\) decreases. The standard error of the average of \\(\\bar{X}\\) over \\(N\\) draws is: \\(\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}\\) In theory, we can get more accurate estimates of \\(p\\) by increasing \\(N\\). In practice, there are limits on the size of \\(N\\) due to costs, as well as other factors we discuss later. We can also use other random variable equations to determine the expected value of the sum of draws \\(\\mbox{E}(S)\\) and standard error of the sum of draws \\(\\mbox{SE}(S)\\). \\(\\mbox{E}(S) = Np\\) \\(\\mbox{SE}(S) = \\sqrt{Np(1-p)}\\) 2.5 Assessment - Parameters and Estimates Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion \\(p\\) of voters are Democrats and \\(1-p\\) are Republicans. Your sample size is \\(N = 25\\). Consider the random variable \\(S\\), which is the total number of Democrats in your sample. What is the expected value of this random variable \\(S\\)? A. \\(\\mbox{E}(S) = 25(1−p)\\) B. \\(\\mbox{E}(S) = 25p\\) C. \\(\\mbox{E}(S) = \\sqrt{25p(1−p)}\\) D. \\(\\mbox{E}(S) = p\\) Again, consider the random variable \\(S\\), which is the total number of Democrats in your sample of 25 voters. The variable \\(p\\) describes the proportion of Democrats in the sample, whereas \\(1-p\\) describes the proportion of Republicans. What is the standard error of \\(S\\)? A. \\(\\mbox{SE}(S) = 25p(1−p)\\) B. \\(\\mbox{SE}(S) = \\sqrt{25p}\\) C. \\(\\mbox{SE}(S) = 25(1−p)\\) D. \\(\\mbox{SE}(S) = \\sqrt{25p(1−p)}\\) Consider the random variable \\(S/N\\), which is equivalent to the sample average that we have been denoting as \\(\\bar{X}\\). The variable \\(N\\) represents the sample size and \\(p\\) is the proportion of Democrats in the population. What is the expected value of \\(\\bar{X}\\)? A. \\(\\mbox{E}(\\bar{X}) = p\\) B. \\(\\mbox{E}(\\bar{X}) = Np\\) C. \\(\\mbox{E}(\\bar{X}) = N(1−p)\\) D. \\(\\mbox{E}(\\bar{X}) = 1−p\\) What is the standard error of the sample average, \\(\\bar{X}\\)? The variable \\(N\\) represents the sample size and \\(p\\) is the proportion of Democrats in the population. A. \\(\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{Np(1−p)}\\) B. \\(\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{p(1−p)/N}\\) C. \\(\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{p(1−p)}\\) D. \\(\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt N\\) Write a line of code that calculates the standard error se of a sample average when you poll 25 people in the population. Generate a sequence of 100 proportions of Democrats p that vary from 0 (no Democrats) to 1 (all Democrats). Plot se versus p for the 100 different proportions. # `N` represents the number of people polled N &lt;- 25 # Create a variable `p` that contains 100 proportions ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function p &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100) # Create a variable `se` that contains the standard error of each sample average se &lt;- sqrt(p * (1 - p)/N) # Plot `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis plot(p,se) Using the same code as in the previous exercise, create a for-loop that generates three plots of p versus se when the sample sizes equal \\(N = 25\\), \\(N = 100\\), and \\(N = 1000\\). # The vector `p` contains 100 proportions of Democrats ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function p &lt;- seq(0, 1, length = 100) # The vector `sample_sizes` contains the three sample sizes sample_sizes &lt;- c(25, 100, 1000) # Write a for-loop that calculates the standard error `se` for every value of `p` for each of the three samples sizes `N` in the vector `sample_sizes`.

Which derivation correctly uses the rules we learned about sums of random variables and scaled random variables to derive the standard error of \\(d\\)? A. \\(\\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} − (1 − \\bar{X}) \\right] = \\mbox{SE} \\left[2 \\bar{X} − 1 \\right] = 2\\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} \\right] = 2 \\sqrt{p/N}\\) B. \\(\\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} − (1 − \\bar{X}) \\right] = \\mbox{SE} \\left[2 \\bar{X} − 1 \\right] = 2\\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} - 1 \\right] = 2 \\sqrt{p(1 − p)/N} − 1\\) C. \\(\\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} − (1 − \\bar{X}) \\right] = \\mbox{SE} \\left[2 \\bar{X} − 1 \\right] = 2\\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} \\right] = 2 \\sqrt{p(1 − p)/N}\\) D. \\(\\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} − (1 − \\bar{X}) \\right] = \\mbox{SE} \\left[\\bar{X} − 1 \\right] = \\mbox{SE} \\left [\\bar{X} \\right] = \\sqrt{p(1 − p)/N}\\) Say the actual proportion of Democratic voters is \\(p = 0.45\\). In this case, the Republican party is winning by a relatively large margin of \\(d = -0.1\\), or a 10% margin of victory. What is the standard error of the spread \\(2 \\bar{X} − 1\\) in this case? # `N` represents the number of people polled N &lt;- 25 # `p` represents the proportion of Democratic voters p &lt;- 0.45 # Calculate the standard error of the spread. Print this value to the console. 2*sqrt((p*(1-p)/N)) ## [1] 0.199 So far we have said that the difference between the proportion of Democratic voters and Republican voters is about 10% and that the standard error of this spread is about 0.2 when \\(N = 25\\). Select the statement that explains why this sample size is sufficient or not. A. This sample size is sufficient because the expected value of our estimate \\(2 \\bar{X} − 1\\) is \\(d\\) so our prediction will be right on. B. This sample size is too small because the standard error is larger than the spread. C. This sample size is sufficient because the standard error of about 0.2 is much smaller than the spread of 10%. D. Without knowing p, we have no way of knowing that increasing our sample size would actually improve our standard error. "],

After completing Section 2, you will be able to: Use the Central Limit Theorem to calculate the probability that a sample estimate \\(\\bar{X}\\) is close to the population proportion \\(p\\). Run a Monte Carlo simulation to corroborate theoretical results built using probability theory. Estimate the spread based on estimates of \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X})\\). Understand why bias can mean that larger sample sizes aren’t necessarily better. 3.1 The Central Limit Theorem in Practice The textbook for this section is available here Key points Because \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sum of random draws divided by a constant, the distribution of \\(\\bar{X}\\) is approximately normal. We can convert \\(\\bar{X}\\) to a standard normal random variable \\(Z\\): \\(Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mbox{E}(\\bar{X})}{\\mbox{SE}(\\bar{X})}\\) The probability that \\(\\bar{X}\\) is within .01 of the actual value of \\(p\\) is: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(Z \\le .01/\\sqrt {p(1 - p)/N}) - \\mbox{Pr}(Z \\le -.01/\\sqrt {p(1 - p)/N})\\) The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) still works if \\(\\bar{X}\\) is used in place of \\(p\\). This is called a plug-in estimate. Hats over values denote estimates. Therefore: \\(\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{\\bar{X}(1 - \\bar{X})/N}\\) Using the CLT, the probability that \\(\\bar{X}\\) is within .01 of the actual value of \\(p\\) is: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(Z \\le .01/\\sqrt {\\bar{X}(1 - \\bar{X})/N}) - \\mbox{Pr}(Z \\le -.01/\\sqrt {\\bar{X}(1 - \\bar{X})/N})\\) Code: Computing the probability of \\(\\bar{X}\\) being within .01 of \\(p\\) X_hat &lt;- 0.48 se &lt;- sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/25) pnorm(0.01/se) - pnorm(-0.01/se) ## [1] 0.0797 3.2 Margin of Error The textbook for this section is available here Key points The margin of error is defined as 2 times the standard error of the estimate \\(\\bar{X}\\). There is about a 95% chance that \\(\\bar{X}\\) will be within two standard errors of the actual parameter \\(p\\). 3.3 A Monte Carlo Simulation for the CLT The textbook for this section is available here Key points We can run Monte Carlo simulations to compare with theoretical results assuming a value of \\(p\\). In practice, \\(p\\) is unknown. We can corroborate theoretical results by running Monte Carlo simulations with one or several values of \\(p\\). One practical choice for \\(p\\) when modeling is \\(\\bar{X}\\), the observed value of \\(\\hat{X}\\) in a sample.

The expected value of the spread is \\(2 \\bar{X} - 1\\). The standard error of the spread is \\(2 \\hat{\\mbox{SE}}(\\bar{X})\\). The margin of error of the spread is 2 times the margin of error of \\(\\bar{X}\\). 3.5 Bias: Why Not Run a Very Large Poll? The textbook for this section is available here Key points An extremely large poll would theoretically be able to predict election results almost perfectly. These sample sizes are not practical. In addition to cost concerns, polling doesn’t reach everyone in the population (eventual voters) with equal probability, and it also may include data from outside our population (people who will not end up voting). These systematic errors in polling are called bias. We will learn more about bias in the future.

The take_sample function you defined previously generates our estimate, \\(\\bar{X}\\). Replicate the random sampling 10,000 times and calculate \\(p − \\bar{X}\\) for each random sample. Save these differences as a vector called errors. Find the average of errors and plot a histogram of the distribution. # Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled p &lt;- 0.45 # Define `N` as the number of people polled N &lt;- 100 # The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated B &lt;- 10000 # Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling set.seed(1) # Create an objected called `errors` that replicates subtracting the result of the `take_sample` function from `p` for `B` replications errors &lt;- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N)) # Calculate the mean of the errors. Print this value to the console. mean(errors) ## [1] -4.9e-05 hist(errors) In the last exercise, you made a vector of differences between the actual value for \\(p\\) and an estimate, \\(\\bar{X}\\). We called these differences between the actual and estimated values errors. The errors object has already been loaded for you. Use the hist function to plot a histogram of the values contained in the vector errors. Which statement best describes the distribution of the errors? A. The errors are all about 0.05. B. The errors are all about -0.05. C. The errors are symmetrically distributed around 0. D. The errors range from -1 to 1. The error \\(p - \\bar{X}\\) is a random variable. In practice, the error is not observed because we do not know the actual proportion of Democratic voters, \\(p\\). However, we can describe the size of the error by constructing a simulation. What is the average size of the error if we define the size by taking the absolute value \\(|p - \\bar{X}|\\)? # Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled p &lt;- 0.45 # Define `N` as the number of people polled N &lt;- 100 # The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated B &lt;- 10000 # Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling set.seed(1) # We generated `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters errors &lt;- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N)) # Calculate the mean of the absolute value of each simulated error. Print this value to the console. mean(abs(errors)) ## [1] 0.0393 The standard error is related to the typical size of the error we make when predicting. We say size because, as we just saw, the errors are centered around 0. In that sense, the typical error is 0. For mathematical reasons related to the central limit theorem, we actually use the standard deviation of errors rather than the average of the absolute values. As we have discussed, the standard error is the square root of the average squared distance \\((\\bar{X} - p)^2\\). The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the distance squared. Calculate the standard deviation of the spread. # Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled p &lt;- 0.45 # Define `N` as the number of people polled N &lt;- 100 # The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated B &lt;- 10000 # Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling set.seed(1) # We generated `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters errors &lt;- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N)) # Calculate the standard deviation of `errors` sqrt(mean(errors^2)) ## [1] 0.0495 The theory we just learned tells us what this standard deviation is going to be because it is the standard error of \\(\\bar{X}\\).

This gives us a practical approach to knowing the typical error we will make if we predict \\(p\\) with \\(\\hat{X}\\). The theoretical result gives us an idea of how large a sample size is required to obtain the precision we need. Earlier we learned that the largest standard errors occur for \\(p = 0.5\\).

After completing Section 3, you will be able to: Calculate confidence intervals of difference sizes around an estimate. Understand that a confidence interval is a random interval with the given probability of falling on top of the parameter. Explain the concept of “power” as it relates to inference. Understand the relationship between p-values and confidence intervals and explain why reporting confidence intervals is often preferable. 4.1 Confidence Intervals The textbook for this section is available here Key points We can use statistical theory to compute the probability that a given interval contains the true parameter \\(p\\). 95% confidence intervals are intervals constructed to have a 95% chance of including \\(p\\). The margin of error is approximately a 95% confidence interval. The start and end of these confidence intervals are random variables. To calculate any size confidence interval, we need to calculate the value \\(z\\) for which \\(\\mbox{Pr}(-z \\le Z \\le z)\\) equals the desired confidence. For example, a 99% confidence interval requires calculating \\(z\\) for \\(\\mbox{Pr}(-z \\le Z \\le z) = 0.99\\). For a confidence interval of size \\(q\\), we solve for \\(z = 1 - \\frac{1 - q}{2}\\). To determine a 95% confidence interval, use z &lt;- qnorm(0.975). This value is slightly smaller than 2 times the standard error. Code: geom_smooth confidence interval example The shaded area around the curve is related to the concept of confidence intervals. data(&quot;nhtemp&quot;) data.frame(year = as.numeric(time(nhtemp)), temperature = as.numeric(nhtemp)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, temperature)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + ggtitle(&quot;Average Yearly Temperatures in New Haven&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Code: Monte Carlo simulation of confidence intervals Note that to compute the exact 95% confidence interval, we would use qnorm(.975)*SE_hat instead of 2*SE_hat. p &lt;- 0.45 N &lt;- 1000 X &lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p)) # generate N observations X_hat &lt;- mean(X) # calculate X_hat SE_hat &lt;- sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N) # calculate SE_hat, SE of the mean of N observations c(X_hat - 2*SE_hat, X_hat + 2*SE_hat) # build interval of 2*SE above and below mean ## [1] 0.414 0.476 Code: Solving for \\(z\\) with qnorm z &lt;- qnorm(0.995) # calculate z to solve for 99% confidence interval pnorm(qnorm(0.995)) # demonstrating that qnorm gives the z value for a given probability ## [1] 0.995 pnorm(qnorm(1-0.995)) # demonstrating symmetry of 1-qnorm ## [1] 0.005 pnorm(z) - pnorm(-z) # demonstrating that this z value gives correct probability for interval ## [1] 0.99 4.2 A Monte Carlo Simulation for Confidence Intervals The textbook for this section is available here Key points We can run a Monte Carlo simulation to confirm that a 95% confidence interval contains the true value of \\(p\\) 95% of the time. A plot of confidence intervals from this simulation demonstrates that most intervals include \\(p\\), but roughly 5% of intervals miss the true value of \\(p\\). Code: Monte Carlo simulation Note that to compute the exact 95% confidence interval, we would use qnorm(.975)*SE_hat instead of 2*SE_hat. B &lt;- 10000 inside &lt;- replicate(B, { X &lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p)) X_hat &lt;- mean(X) SE_hat &lt;- sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N) between(p, X_hat - 2*SE_hat, X_hat + 2*SE_hat) # TRUE if p in confidence interval }) mean(inside) ## [1] 0.957 4.3 The Correct Language The textbook for this section is available here Key points The 95% confidence intervals are random, but \\(p\\) is not random. 95% refers to the probability that the random interval falls on top of \\(p\\). It is technically incorrect to state that \\(p\\) has a 95% chance of being in between two values because that implies \\(p\\) is random. 4.4 Power The textbook for this section is available here Key points If we are trying to predict the result of an election, then a confidence interval that includes a spread of 0 (a tie) is not helpful. A confidence interval that includes a spread of 0 does not imply a close election, it means the sample size is too small. Power is the probability of detecting an effect when there is a true effect to find. Power increases as sample size increases, because larger sample size means smaller standard error. Code: Confidence interval for the spread with sample size of 25 Note that to compute the exact 95% confidence interval, we would use c(-qnorm(.975), qnorm(.975)) instead of 1.96. N &lt;- 25 X_hat &lt;- 0.48 (2*X_hat - 1) + c(-2, 2)*2*sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N) ## [1] -0.44 0.36 4.5 p-Values The textbook for this section is available here Key points The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no effect. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the spread is 0, or \\(p = 0.5\\). The p-value is the probability of detecting an effect of a certain size or larger when the null hypothesis is true. We can convert the probability of seeing an observed value under the null hypothesis into a standard normal random variable. We compute the value of \\(z\\) that corresponds to the observed result, and then use that \\(z\\) to compute the p-value. If a 95% confidence interval does not include our observed value, then the p-value must be smaller than 0.05. It is preferable to report confidence intervals instead of p-values, as confidence intervals give information about the size of the estimate and p-values do not. Code: Computing a p-value for observed spread of 0.02 N &lt;- 100 # sample size z &lt;- sqrt(N) * 0.02/0.5 # spread of 0.02 1 - (pnorm(z) - pnorm(-z)) ## [1] 0.689 4.6 Another Explanation of p-Values The p-value is the probability of observing a value as extreme or more extreme than the result given that the null hypothesis is true. In the context of the normal distribution, this refers to the probability of observing a Z-score whose absolute value is as high or higher than the Z-score of interest. Suppose we want to find the p-value of an observation 2 standard deviations larger than the mean. This means we are looking for anything with \\(|z| \\ge 2\\). Graphically, the p-value gives the probability of an observation that’s at least as far away from the mean or further. This plot shows a standard normal distribution (centered at \\(z = 0\\)) with a standard deviation of 1). The shaded tails are the region of the graph that are 2 standard deviations or more away from the mean. Standard normal distribution (centered at z=0 with a standard deviation of 1 The p-value is the proportion of area under a normal curve that has z-scores as extreme or more extreme than the given value - the tails on this plot of a normal distribution are shaded to show the region corresponding to the p-value. The right tail can be found with 1-pnorm(2). We want to have both tails, though, because we want to find the probability of any observation as far away from the mean or farther, in either direction. (This is what’s meant by a two-tailed p-value.) Because the distribution is symmetrical, the right and left tails are the same size and we know that our desired value is just 2*(1-pnorm(2)). Recall that, by default, pnorm() gives the CDF for a normal distribution with a mean of \\(\\mu = 0\\) and standard deviation of \\(\\sigma = 1\\). To find p-values for a given z-score z in a normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma, use 2*(1-pnorm(z, mu, sigma)) instead. 4.7 Assessment - Confidence Intervals and p-Values For the following exercises, we will use actual poll data from the 2016 election. The exercises will contain pre-loaded data from the dslabs package. library(dslabs) data(&quot;polls_us_election_2016&quot;) We will use all the national polls that ended within a few weeks before the election.

After completing Section 4, you will be able to: Understand how aggregating data from different sources, as poll aggregators do for poll data, can improve the precision of a prediction. Understand how to fit a multilevel model to the data to forecast, for example, election results. Explain why a simple aggregation of data is insufficient to combine results because of factors such as pollster bias. Use a data-driven model to account for additional types of sampling variability such as pollster-to-pollster variability. 5.1 Poll Aggregators The textbook for this section is available here and here Key points Poll aggregators combine the results of many polls to simulate polls with a large sample size and therefore generate more precise estimates than individual polls. Polls can be simulated with a Monte Carlo simulation and used to construct an estimate of the spread and confidence intervals. The actual data science exercise of forecasting elections involves more complex statistical modeling, but these underlying ideas still apply.

This is because they use different statistical models. We will use actual polling data about the popular vote from the 2016 US presidential election to learn the principles of statistical modeling. 5.3 Poll Data and Pollster Bias The textbook for this section is available here and here Key points We analyze real 2016 US polling data organized by FiveThirtyEight. We start by using reliable national polls taken within the week before the election to generate an urn model. Consider \\(p\\) the proportion voting for Clinton and \\(1 - p\\) the proportion voting for Trump. We are interested in the spread \\(d = 2p - 1\\). Poll results are a random normal variable with expected value of the spread \\(d\\) and standard error \\(2 \\sqrt{p(1 - p)/N}\\). Our initial estimate of the spread did not include the actual spread. Part of the reason is that different pollsters have different numbers of polls in our dataset, and each pollster has a bias. Pollster bias reflects the fact that repeated polls by a given pollster have an expected value different from the actual spread and different from other pollsters. Each pollster has a different bias. The urn model does not account for pollster bias. We will develop a more flexible data-driven model that can account for effects like bias.

We assume the expected value of this model is the actual spread \\(d = 2p - 1\\). Our new standard error \\(\\sigma\\) now factors in pollster-to-pollster variability. It can no longer be calculated from \\(p\\) or \\(d\\) and is an unknown parameter. The central limit theorem still works to estimate the sample average of many polls \\(X_1,...,X_N\\) because the average of the sum of many random variables is a normally distributed random variable with expected value \\(d\\) and standard error \\(\\sigma / \\sqrt{N}\\). We can estimate the unobserved \\(\\sigma\\) as the sample standard deviation, which is calculated with the sd function.

However, most data science applications are not related to data obtained from urns. More common are data that come from individuals. Probability plays a role because the data come from a random sample. The random sample is taken from a population and the urn serves as an analogy for the population. Let’s revisit the heights dataset. For now, consider x to be the heights of all males in the data set. Mathematically speaking, x is our population. Using the urn analogy, we have an urn with the values of x in it. What are the population average and standard deviation of our population? data(heights) # Make a vector of heights from all males in the population x &lt;- heights %&gt;% filter(sex == &quot;Male&quot;) %&gt;% .$height # Calculate the population average.

It is a random variable with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and standard error \\(\\sigma\\). D. It underestimates \\(\\mu\\).

Here we will examine that bias more rigorously. Lets consider two pollsters that conducted daily polls and look at national polls for the month before the election. Is there a poll bias?

However, these data are subject to variability. Perhaps the differences we observe are due to chance. Under the urn model, both pollsters should have the same expected value: the election day difference, \\(d\\). We will model the observed data \\(Y_{ij}\\) in the following way: \\(Y_{ij} = d + b_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) with \\(i = 1, 2\\) indexing the two pollsters, \\(b_i\\) the bias for pollster \\(i\\), and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) poll to poll chance variability. We assume the \\(\\varepsilon\\) are independent from each other, have expected value 0 and standard deviation \\(\\sigma_i\\) regardless of \\(j\\). Which of the following statements best reflects what we need to know to determine if our data fit the urn model? A. Is \\(\\varepsilon_{ij} = 0\\)? B. How close are \\(Y_{ij}\\) to \\(d\\)? C. Is \\(b_1 \\neq b_2\\)? D. Are \\(b_1 = 0\\) and \\(b_2 = 0\\)? We modelled the observed data \\(Y_{ij}\\) as: \\(Y_{ij} = d + b_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) On the right side of this model, only \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is a random variable. The other two values are constants. What is the expected value of \\(Y_{1j}\\)? A. \\(d + b_1\\) B. \\(b_1 + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) C. \\(d\\) D. \\(d + b_1 + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) Suppose we define \\(\\bar{Y}_1\\) as the average of poll results from the first poll and \\(\\sigma_1\\) as the standard deviation of the first poll. What is the expected value and standard error of \\(\\bar{Y}_1\\)? A. The expected value is \\(d + b_1\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_1\\) B. The expected value is \\(d\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_1/\\sqrt{N_1}\\) C. The expected value is \\(d + b_1\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_1/\\sqrt{N_1}\\) D. The expected value is \\(d\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_1 + \\sqrt{N_1}\\) Now we define \\(\\bar{Y}_2\\) as the average of poll results from the second poll. What is the expected value and standard error of \\(\\bar{Y}_2\\)? A. The expected value is \\(d + b_2\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_2\\) B. The expected value is \\(d\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_2/\\sqrt{N_2}\\) C. The expected value is \\(d + b_2\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_2/\\sqrt{N_2}\\) D. The expected value is \\(d\\) and the standard error is \\(\\sigma_2 + \\sqrt{N_2}\\) Using what we learned by answering the previous questions, what is the expected value of \\(\\bar{Y}_2 − \\bar{Y}_1\\)? A. \\((b_2 − b_1)^2\\) B. \\(b_2 − b_1/\\sqrt(N)\\) C. \\(b_2 + b_1\\) D. \\(b_2 − b_1\\) Standard Error of the Difference Between Polls Using what we learned by answering the questions above, what is the standard error of \\(\\bar{Y}_2 − \\bar{Y}_1\\)? A. \\(\\sqrt{\\sigma_2^2/N_2 + \\sigma_1^2/N_1}\\) B. \\(\\sqrt{\\sigma_2/N_2 + \\sigma_1/N_1}\\) C. \\((\\sigma_2^2/N_2 + \\sigma_1^2/N_1)^2\\) D. \\(\\sigma_2^2/N_2 + \\sigma_1^2/N_1\\) The answer to the previous question depends on \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\), which we don’t know. We learned that we can estimate these values using the sample standard deviation. Compute the estimates of \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\). # The `polls` data have already been loaded for you.

A. The central limit theorem cannot tell us anything because this difference is not the average of a sample. B. Because \\(Y_{ij}\\) are approximately normal, the averages are normal too. C. If we assume \\(N_2\\) and \\(N_1\\) are large enough, \\(\\bar{Y}_2\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}_1\\), and their difference, are approximately normal. D. These data do not contain vectors of 0 and 1, so the central limit theorem does not apply. We have constructed a random variable that has expected value \\(b_2 − b_1\\), the pollster bias difference. If our model holds, then this random variable has an approximately normal distribution. The standard error of this random variable depends on \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\), but we can use the sample standard deviations we computed earlier.

Note that our data has more than two pollsters. We can also test for pollster effect using all pollsters, not just two. The idea is to compare the variability across polls to variability within polls. We can construct statistics to test for effects and approximate their distribution. The area of statistics that does this is called Analysis of Variance or ANOVA. We do not cover it here, but ANOVA provides a very useful set of tools to answer questions such as: is there a pollster effect?

After completing Section 5, you will be able to: Apply Bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability of A given B. Understand how to use hierarchical models to make better predictions by considering multiple levels of variability. Compute a posterior probability using an empirical Bayesian approach. Calculate a 95% credible interval from a posterior probability. 6.1 Bayesian Statistics The textbook for this section is available here Key points In the urn model, it does not make sense to talk about the probability of \\(p\\) being greater than a certain value because \\(p\\) is a fixed value. With Bayesian statistics, we assume that \\(p\\) is in fact random, which allows us to calculate probabilities related to \\(p\\). Hierarchical models describe variability at different levels and incorporate all these levels into a model for estimating \\(p\\). 6.2 Bayes’ Theorem The textbook for this section is available here Key points Bayes’ Theorem states that the probability of event A happening given event B is equal to the probability of both A and B divided by the probability of event B: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(A \\mid B) = \\frac{\\mbox{Pr}(B \\mid A)\\mbox{Pr}(A)}{\\mbox{Pr}(B)}\\) Bayes’ Theorem shows that a test for a very rare disease will have a high percentage of false positives even if the accuracy of the test is high. Equations: Cystic fibrosis test probabilities In these probabilities, + represents a positive test, - represents a negative test, \\(D = 0\\) indicates no disease, and \\(D = 1\\) indicates the disease is present. Probability of having the disease given a positive test: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(D = 1 \\mid +)\\) 99% test accuracy when disease is present: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(+ \\mid D = 1) = 0.99\\) 99% test accuracy when disease is absent: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(- \\mid D = 0) = 0.99\\) Rate of cystic fibrosis: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(D = 1) = 0.00025\\) Bayes’ theorem can be applied like this: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(D = 1 \\mid +) = \\frac{\\mbox{Pr}(+ \\mid D = 1)⋅\\mbox{Pr}(D = 1)}{\\mbox{Pr}(+)}\\) \\(\\mbox{Pr}(D = 1 \\mid +) = \\frac{\\mbox{Pr}(+ \\mid D = 1)⋅\\mbox{Pr}(D = 1)}{\\mbox{Pr}(+ \\mid D=1)⋅\\mbox{Pr}(D = 1) + \\mbox{Pr}(+ \\mid D = 0)⋅\\mbox{Pr}(D = 0)}\\) Substituting known values, we obtain: \\(\\frac{0.99⋅0.00025}{0.99⋅0.00025 + 0.01⋅0.99975} = 0.02\\) Code: Monte Carlo simulation prev &lt;- 0.00025 # disease prevalence N &lt;- 100000 # number of tests outcome &lt;- sample(c(&quot;Disease&quot;, &quot;Healthy&quot;), N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(prev, 1-prev)) N_D &lt;- sum(outcome == &quot;Disease&quot;) # number with disease N_H &lt;- sum(outcome == &quot;Healthy&quot;) # number healthy # for each person, randomly determine if test is + or - accuracy &lt;- 0.99 test &lt;- vector(&quot;character&quot;, N) test[outcome == &quot;Disease&quot;] &lt;- sample(c(&quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;), N_D, replace=TRUE, prob = c(accuracy, 1-accuracy)) test[outcome == &quot;Healthy&quot;] &lt;- sample(c(&quot;-&quot;, &quot;+&quot;), N_H, replace=TRUE, prob = c(accuracy, 1-accuracy)) table(outcome, test) ## test ## outcome - + ## Disease 0 27 ## Healthy 99013 960 6.3 Bayes in Practice The textbook for this section is available here Key points The techniques we have used up until now are referred to as frequentist statistics as they consider only the frequency of outcomes in a dataset and do not include any outside information. Frequentist statistics allow us to compute confidence intervals and p-values. Frequentist statistics can have problems when sample sizes are small and when the data are extreme compared to historical results. Bayesian statistics allows prior knowledge to modify observed results, which alters our conclusions about event probabilities. 6.4 The Hierarchical Model The textbook for this section is available here Key points Hierarchical models use multiple levels of variability to model results. They are hierarchical because values in the lower levels of the model are computed using values from higher levels of the model. We model baseball player batting average using a hierarchical model with two levels of variability: \\(p \\sim N(\\mu, \\tau)\\) describes player-to-player variability in natural ability to hit, which has a mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\tau\\). \\(Y \\mid p \\sim N(p, \\sigma)\\) describes a player’s observed batting average given their ability \\(p\\), which has a mean \\(p\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{p(1 - p)/N}\\). This represents variability due to luck. In Bayesian hierarchical models, the first level is called the prior distribution and the second level is called the sampling distribution. The posterior distribution allows us to compute the probability distribution of \\(p\\) given that we have observed data \\(Y\\). By the continuous version of Bayes’ rule, the expected value of the posterior distribution \\(p\\) given \\(Y = y\\) is a weighted average between the prior mean \\(\\mu\\) and the observed data \\(Y\\): \\(\\mbox{E}(p \\mid y) = B\\mu + (1 - B)Y\\) where \\(B = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\tau^2}\\) The standard error of the posterior distribution \\(\\mbox{SE}(p\\mid Y)^2\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{{1/\\sigma^2} + {1/\\tau^2}}\\). Note that you will need to take the square root of both sides to solve for the standard error. This Bayesian approach is also known as shrinking. When \\(\\sigma\\) is large, \\(B\\) is close to 1 and our prediction of \\(p\\) shrinks towards the mean (\\(\\mu\\)). When \\(\\sigma\\) is small, \\(B\\) is close to 0 and our prediction of \\(p\\) is more weighted towards the observed data \\(Y\\). 6.5 Assessment - Bayesian Statistics In 1999 in England Sally Clark was found guilty of the murder of two of her sons. Both infants were found dead in the morning, one in 1996 and another in 1998, and she claimed the cause of death was sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). No evidence of physical harm was found on the two infants so the main piece of evidence against her was the testimony of Professor Sir Roy Meadow, who testified that the chances of two infants dying of SIDS was 1 in 73 million. He arrived at this figure by finding that the rate of SIDS was 1 in 8,500 and then calculating that the chance of two SIDS cases was \\(8,500 × 8,500 \\approx \\text{73 million}\\). Based on what we’ve learned throughout this course, which statement best describes a potential flaw in Sir Meadow’s reasoning? A. Sir Meadow assumed the second death was independent of the first son being affected, thereby ignoring possible genetic causes. B. There is no flaw. The multiplicative rule always applies in this way: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{A and B}) = \\mbox{Pr}(A)\\mbox{Pr}(B)\\) C. Sir Meadow should have added the probabilities: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{A and B}) = \\mbox{Pr}(A) + \\mbox{Pr}(B)\\) D. The rate of SIDS is too low to perform these types of statistics. Let’s assume that there is in fact a genetic component to SIDS and the the probability of \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{second case of SIDS} \\mid \\text{first case of SIDS}) = 1/100\\), is much higher than 1 in 8,500. What is the probability of both of Sally Clark’s sons dying of SIDS? # Define `Pr_1` as the probability of the first son dying of SIDS Pr_1 &lt;- 1/8500 # Define `Pr_2` as the probability of the second son dying of SIDS Pr_2 &lt;- 1/100 # Calculate the probability of both sons dying of SIDS. Print this value to the console. Pr_1 * Pr_2 ## [1] 1.18e-06 Many press reports stated that the expert claimed the probability of Sally Clark being innocent as 1 in 73 million. Perhaps the jury and judge also interpreted the testimony this way. This probability can be written like this: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{mother is a murderer} \\mid \\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm})\\) Bayes’ rule tells us this probability is equal to: A. \\(\\frac{\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm})\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{mother is a murderer})}{\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm})}\\) B. \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm})\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{mother is a murderer})\\) C. \\(\\frac{\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm} \\mid \\text{mother is a murderer})\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{mother is a murderer})}{\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm})}\\) D. 1/8500 Assume that the probability of a murderer finding a way to kill her two children without leaving evidence of physical harm is: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm} \\mid \\text{mother is a murderer}) = 0.50\\) Assume that the murder rate among mothers is 1 in 1,000,000. \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{mother is a murderer}) = 1/1,000,000\\) According to Bayes’ rule, what is the probability of: \\(\\mbox{Pr}(\\text{mother is a murderer} \\mid \\text{two children found dead with no evidence of harm})\\) # Define `Pr_1` as the probability of the first son dying of SIDS Pr_1 &lt;- 1/8500 # Define `Pr_2` as the probability of the second son dying of SIDS Pr_2 &lt;- 1/100 # Define `Pr_B` as the probability of both sons dying of SIDS Pr_B &lt;- Pr_1*Pr_2 # Define Pr_A as the rate of mothers that are murderers Pr_A &lt;- 1/1000000 # Define Pr_BA as the probability that two children die without evidence of harm, given that their mother is a murderer Pr_BA &lt;- 0.50 # Define Pr_AB as the probability that a mother is a murderer, given that her two children died with no evidence of physical harm. Print this value to the console. Pr_AB &lt;- (Pr_BA * Pr_A)/Pr_B Pr_AB ## [1] 0.425 After Sally Clark was found guilty, the Royal Statistical Society issued a statement saying that there was “no statistical basis” for the expert’s claim. They expressed concern at the “misuse of statistics in the courts”. Eventually, Sally Clark was acquitted in June 2003. In addition to misusing the multiplicative rule as we saw earlier, what else did Sir Meadow miss? A. He made an arithmetic error in forgetting to divide by the rate of SIDS in siblings. B. He did not take into account how rare it is for a mother to murder her children. C. He mixed up the numerator and denominator of Bayes’ rule. D. He did not take into account murder rates in the population. Florida is one of the most closely watched states in the U.S. election because it has many electoral votes and the election is generally close. Create a table with the poll spread results from Florida taken during the last days before the election using the sample code.

After completing Section 6, you will be able to: Understand how pollsters use hierarchical models to forecast the results of elections. Incorporate multiple sources of variability into a mathematical model to make predictions. Construct confidence intervals that better model deviations such as those seen in election data using the t-distribution. 7.1 Election Forecasting The textbook for this section is available here Key points In our model: The spread \\(d \\sim N(\\mu, \\tau)\\) describes our best guess in the absence of polling data. We set \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\tau = 0.035\\) using historical data. The average of observed data \\(\\bar{X} \\mid d \\sim N(d, \\sigma)\\) describes randomness due to sampling and the pollster effect. Because the posterior distribution is normal, we can report a 95% credible interval that has a 95% chance of overlapping the parameter using \\(\\mbox{E}(p \\mid Y)\\) and \\(\\mbox{SE}(p \\mid Y)\\). Given an estimate of \\(\\mbox{E}(p \\mid Y)\\) and \\(\\mbox{SE}(p \\mid Y)\\), we can use pnorm to compute the probability that \\(d&gt;0\\). It is common to see a general bias that affects all pollsters in the same way. This bias cannot be predicted or measured before the election. We will include a term in later models to account for this variability.

We represent each measurement as \\(X_{i,j} = d + b + h_i + \\epsilon_{i,j}\\) where: The index \\(i\\) represents the different pollsters The index \\(j\\) represents the different polls \\(X_{i,j}\\) is the \\(j\\)th poll by the \\(i\\)th pollster \\(d\\) is the actual spread of the election \\(b\\) is the general bias affecting all pollsters \\(h_i\\) represents the house effect for the \\(i\\)th pollster \\(\\epsilon_{i,j}\\) represents the random error associated with the \\(i,j\\)th poll.

We use the left_join() function to combine the number of electoral votes with our poll results. For each state, we apply a Bayesian approach to generate an Election Day \\(d\\) . We keep our prior simple by assuming an expected value of 0 and a standard deviation based on recent history of 0.02. We can run a Monte Carlo simulation that for each iteration simulates poll results in each state using that state’s average and standard deviation, awards electoral votes for each state to Clinton if the spread is greater than 0, then compares the number of electoral votes won to the number of votes required to win the election (over 269). If we run a Monte Carlo simulation for the electoral college without accounting for general bias, we overestimate Clinton’s chances of winning at over 99%.

Variability within a single pollster comes from time variation. In order to forecast, our model must include a bias term \\(b_t\\) to model the time effect. Pollsters also try to estimate \\(f(t)\\), the trend of \\(p\\) given time \\(t\\) using a model like: \\(Y_{i, j, t} = d + b + h_j + b_t + f(t) + \\epsilon_{i, j, t}\\) Once we decide on a model, we can use historical data and current data to estimate the necessary parameters to make predictions.

Given \\(s\\) as an estimate of \\(\\sigma\\), then \\(Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - d}{s/\\sqrt{N}}\\) follows a t-distribution with \\(N - 1\\) degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom determine the weight of the tails of the distribution. Small values of degrees of freedom lead to increased probabilities of extreme values. We can determine confidence intervals using the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution by calculating the desired quantile with the function qt().

Calculate the probability of seeing t-distributed random variables being more than 2 in absolute value when the degrees of freedom are 3. # Calculate the probability of seeing t-distributed random variables being more than 2 in absolute value when &#39;df = 3&#39;. 1 - pt(2, df = 3) + pt(-2, df = 3) ## [1] 0.139 Now use sapply to compute the same probability for degrees of freedom from 3 to 50. Make a plot and notice when this probability converges to the normal distribution’s 5%. # Generate a vector &#39;df&#39; that contains a sequence of numbers from 3 to 50 df &lt;- c(3:50) # Make a function called &#39;pt_func&#39; that calculates the probability that a value is more than |2| for any degrees of freedom pt_function &lt;- function(f) { 1 - pt(2, f) + pt(-2, f) } # Generate a vector &#39;probs&#39; that uses the `pt_func` function to calculate the probabilities probs &lt;- sapply(df, pt_function) # Plot &#39;df&#39; on the x-axis and &#39;probs&#39; on the y-axis plot(df, probs) In a previous section, we repeatedly took random samples of 50 heights from a distribution of heights. We noticed that about 95% of the samples had confidence intervals spanning the true population mean. Re-do this Monte Carlo simulation, but now instead of \\(N = 50\\), use \\(N = 15\\). Notice what happens to the proportion of hits. # Use the sample code to generate &#39;x&#39;, a vector of male heights x &lt;- heights %&gt;% filter(sex == &quot;Male&quot;) %&gt;% .$height # Create variables for the mean height &#39;mu&#39;, the sample size &#39;N&#39;, and the number of times the simulation should run &#39;B&#39; mu &lt;- mean(x) N &lt;- 15 B &lt;- 10000 # Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling set.seed(1) # Generate a logical vector &#39;res&#39; that contains the results of the simulations res &lt;- replicate(B, { X &lt;- sample(x, N, replace = TRUE) interval &lt;- mean(X) + c(-1,1)*qnorm(0.975)*sd(X)/sqrt(N) between(mu, interval[1], interval[2]) } ) # Calculate the proportion of times the simulation produced values within the 95% confidence interval.

Print this value to the console. p_hit &lt;- mean(res) p_hit ## [1] 0.951 Why did the t-distribution confidence intervals work so much better? A. The t-distribution takes the variability into account and generates larger confidence intervals. B. Because the t-distribution shifts the intervals in the direction towards the actual mean. C. This was just a chance occurrence. If we run it again, the CLT will work better. D. The t-distribution is always a better approximation than the normal distribution. "],

After completing Section 7, you will be able to: Use association and chi-squared tests to perform inference on binary, categorical, and ordinal data. Calculate an odds ratio to get an idea of the magnitude of an observed effect. 8.1 Association Tests The textbook for this section is available here up to and including the textbook section on two-by-two tables. Key points We learn how to determine the probability that an observation is due to random variability given categorical, binary or ordinal data. Fisher’s exact test determines the p-value as the probability of observing an outcome as extreme or more extreme than the observed outcome given the null distribution. Data from a binary experiment are often summarized in two-by-two tables. The p-value can be calculated from a two-by-two table using Fisher’s exact test with the function fisher.test().

Otherwise, we must use the chi-squared test. The chi-squared test compares the observed two-by-two table to the two-by-two table expected by the null hypothesis and asks how likely it is that we see a deviation as large as observed or larger by chance. The function chisq.test() takes a two-by-two table and returns the p-value from the chi-squared test. The odds ratio states how many times larger the odds of an outcome are for one group relative to another group. A small p-value does not imply a large odds ratio. If a finding has a small p-value but also a small odds ratio, it may not be a practically significant or scientifically significant finding. Because the odds ratio is a ratio of ratios, there is no simple way to use the Central Limit Theorem to compute confidence intervals. There are advanced methods for computing confidence intervals for odds ratios that we do not discuss here.

Imagine we expanded our analysis to include all election polls and we repeat our analysis. In this hypothetical scenario, we get that the p-value for the difference in prediction success if 0.0015 and the odds ratio describing the effect size of the performance of grade A- over grade B- polls is 1.07. Based on what we learned in the last section, which statement reflects the best interpretation of this result? A. The p-value is below 0.05, so there is a significant difference. Grade A- polls are significantly better at predicting winners. B. The p-value is too close to 0.05 to call this a significant difference. We do not observe a difference in performance. C. The p-value is below 0.05, but the odds ratio is very close to 1. There is not a scientifically significant difference in performance. D. The p-value is below 0.05 and the odds ratio indicates that grade A- polls perform significantly better than grade C- polls. 8.4 Comprehensive Assessment: Brexit 8.5 Brexit poll analysis - Part 1 Directions There are 12 multi-part problems in this comprehensive assessment that review concepts from the entire course. The problems are split over 3 pages. Make sure you read the instructions carefully and run all pre-exercise code. For numeric entry problems, you have 10 attempts to input the correct answer. For true/false problems, you have 2 attempts. If you have questions, visit the “Brexit poll analysis” discussion forum that follows the assessment. IMPORTANT: Some of these exercises use dslabs datasets that were added in a July 2019 update. Make sure your package is up to date with the command install.packages(\"dslabs\"). Overview In June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum to determine whether the country would “Remain” in the European Union (EU) or “Leave” the EU. This referendum is commonly known as Brexit. Although the media and others interpreted poll results as forecasting “Remain” (\\(p &gt; 0.5\\)), the actual proportion that voted “Remain” was only 48.1% (\\(p = 0.481\\)) and the UK thus voted to leave the EU. Pollsters in the UK were criticized for overestimating support for “Remain”. In this project, you will analyze real Brexit polling data to develop polling models to forecast Brexit results. You will write your own code in R and enter the answers on the edX platform. Important definitions Data Import Import the brexit_polls polling data from the dslabs package and set options for the analysis: # suggested options options(digits = 3) # load brexit_polls object data(brexit_polls) Final Brexit parameters Define \\(p = 0.481\\) as the actual percent voting “Remain” on the Brexit referendum and \\(d = 2p - 1 = -0.038\\) as the actual spread of the Brexit referendum with “Remain” defined as the positive outcome: p &lt;- 0.481 # official proportion voting &quot;Remain&quot; d &lt;- 2*p-1 # official spread 8.5.0.1 Question 1: The final proportion of voters choosing “Remain” was p=0.481. Consider a poll with a sample of N=1500 voters. What is the expected total number of voters in the sample choosing “Remain”? p &lt;- 0.481 N &lt;- 1500 N*p ## [1] 722 What is the standard error of the total number of voters in the sample choosing “Remain”? sqrt(N*p*(1-p)) ## [1] 19.4 What is the expected value of \\(\\hat{X}\\), the proportion of “Remain” voters?

Raw proportions of voters preferring “Remain”, “Leave”, and “Undecided” are available (remain, leave, undecided) The spread is also available (spread), which is the difference in the raw proportion of voters choosing “Remain” and the raw proportion choosing “Leave”. Calculate x_hat for each poll, the estimate of the proportion of voters choosing “Remain” on the referendum day (\\(p = 0.481\\)), given the observed spread and the relationship \\(\\hat{d} = 2\\hat{X} - 1\\). Use mutate() to add a variable x_hat to the `brexit_polls object by filling in the skeleton code below: brexit_polls &lt;- brexit_polls %&gt;% mutate(x_hat = __________) What is the average of the observed spreads (spread)? brexit_polls &lt;- brexit_polls %&gt;% mutate(x_hat = (spread+1)/2) mean(brexit_polls$spread) ## [1] 0.0201 What is the standard deviation of the observed spreads? sd(brexit_polls$spread) ## [1] 0.0588 What is the average of x_hat, the estimates of the parameter \\(p\\)? mean(brexit_polls$x_hat) ## [1] 0.51 What is the standard deviation of x_hat? sd(brexit_polls$x_hat) ## [1] 0.0294 8.5.0.3 Question 3: Confidence interval of a Brexit poll Consider the first poll in brexit_polls, a YouGov poll run on the same day as the Brexit referendum: brexit_polls[1,] ## startdate enddate pollster poll_type samplesize remain leave undecided spread x_hat ## 1 2016-06-23 2016-06-23 YouGov Online 4772 0.52 0.48 0 0.04 0.52 Use qnorm to compute the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\hat{X}\\).

The interval predicts a winner and covers the true value of \\(p\\). B. The interval predicts a winner but does not cover the true value of \\(p\\). C. The interval does not predict a winner but does cover the true value of \\(p\\). D. The interval does not predict a winner and does not cover the true value of \\(p\\). 8.6 Brexit poll analysis - Part 2 8.6.0.1 Question 4: Create the data frame june_polls containing only Brexit polls ending in June 2016 (enddate of “2016-06-01” and later). We will calculate confidence intervals for all polls and determine how many cover the true value of \\(d\\). First, use mutate() to calculate a plug-in estimate se_x_hat for the standard error of the estimate \\(\\hat{\\mbox{SE}}[X]\\) for each poll given its sample size and value of \\(\\hat{X}\\) (x_hat). Second, use mutate() to calculate an estimate for the standard error of the spread for each poll given the value of se_x_hat. Then, use mutate() to calculate upper and lower bounds for 95% confidence intervals of the spread. Last, add a column hit that indicates whether the confidence interval for each poll covers the correct spread \\(d = -0.038\\). How many polls are in june_polls? june_polls &lt;- brexit_polls %&gt;% filter(enddate &gt;= &quot;2016-06-01&quot;) nrow(june_polls) ## [1] 32 What proportion of polls have a confidence interval that covers the value 0? june_polls &lt;- june_polls %&gt;% mutate(se_x_hat = sqrt(x_hat*(1-x_hat)/samplesize), se_spread = 2*se_x_hat, ci_lower_spread = spread - qnorm(0.975)*se_spread, ci_upper_spread = spread + qnorm(0.975)*se_spread) mean(june_polls$ci_lower_spread &lt; 0 &amp; june_polls$ci_upper_spread &gt; 0) ## [1] 0.625 What proportion of polls predict “Remain” (confidence interval entirely above 0)? mean(june_polls$ci_lower_spread &gt; 0) ## [1] 0.125 What proportion of polls have a confidence interval covering the true value of \\(d\\)? june_polls &lt;- june_polls %&gt;% mutate(hit = (2*p-1 &gt; ci_lower_spread) &amp; (2*p-1 &lt; ci_upper_spread)) mean(june_polls$hit) ## [1] 0.562 8.6.0.2 Question 5: Group and summarize the june_polls object by pollster to find the proportion of hits for each pollster and the number of polls per pollster. Use arrange() to sort by hit rate. june_polls %&gt;% group_by(pollster) %&gt;% summarize(hit_rate=mean(hit), n()) %&gt;% arrange(hit_rate) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) ## # A tibble: 12 x 3 ## pollster hit_rate `n()` ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 BMG Research 0 2 ## 2 ORB/Telegraph 0 1 ## 3 Populus 0 1 ## 4 ComRes 0.333 3 ## 5 Ipsos MORI 0.5 2 ## 6 Survation 0.5 2 ## 7 YouGov 0.556 9 ## 8 Opinium 0.667 3 ## 9 ORB 0.667 3 ## 10 ICM 1 3 ## 11 Survation/IG Group 1 1 ## 12 TNS 1 2 Which of the following are TRUE?

All pollsters produced confidence intervals covering the correct spread in at least 1 of their polls. E. The results are consistent with a large general bias that affects all pollsters. 8.6.0.3 Question 6: Boxplot of Brexit polls by poll type Make a boxplot of the spread in june_polls by poll type. june_polls %&gt;% group_by(poll_type) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(poll_type,spread)) + geom_boxplot() Which of the following are TRUE? A. Online polls tend to show support for “Remain” (spread &gt; 0). B. Telephone polls tend to show support “Remain” (spread &gt; 0). C.

Poll type introduces a bias that affects poll results. 8.6.0.4 Question 7: Calculate the confidence intervals of the spread combined across all polls in june_polls, grouping by poll type. Recall that to determine the standard error of the spread, you will need to double the standard error of the estimate. Use this code (which determines the total sample size per poll type, gives each spread estimate a weight based on the poll’s sample size, and adds an estimate of p from the combined spread) to begin your analysis: combined_by_type &lt;- june_polls %&gt;% group_by(poll_type) %&gt;% summarize(N = sum(samplesize), spread = sum(spread*samplesize)/N, p_hat = (spread + 1)/2) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) #What is the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for online voters? combined_by_type &lt;- june_polls %&gt;% group_by(poll_type) %&gt;% summarize(N = sum(samplesize), spread = sum(spread*samplesize)/N, p_hat = (spread + 1)/2, se_spread = 2*sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/N), spread_lower = spread - qnorm(.975)*se_spread, spread_upper = spread + qnorm(.975)*se_spread) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) combined_by_type %&gt;% filter(poll_type == &quot;Online&quot;) %&gt;% pull(spread_lower) ## [1] -0.0165 What is the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for online voters? combined_by_type %&gt;% filter(poll_type == &quot;Online&quot;) %&gt;% pull(spread_upper) ## [1] 0.00165 8.6.0.5 Question 8: Interpret the confidence intervals for the combined spreads for each poll type calculated in the previous problem. Which of the following are TRUE about the confidence intervals of the combined spreads for different poll types? Select ALL correct answers. A. Neither set of combined polls makes a prediction about the outcome of the Brexit referendum (a prediction is possible if a confidence interval does not cover 0). B. The confidence interval for online polls is larger than the confidence interval for telephone polls. C. The confidence interval for telephone polls is covers more positive values than the confidence interval for online polls. D. The confidence intervals for different poll types do not overlap. E. Neither confidence interval covers the true value of 𝑑=−0.038. 8.7 Brexit poll analysis - Part 3 8.7.0.1 Question 9: Define brexit_hit, with the following code, which computes the confidence intervals for all Brexit polls in 2016 and then calculates whether the confidence interval covers the actual value of the spread \\(d = -0.038\\): brexit_hit &lt;- brexit_polls %&gt;% mutate(p_hat = (spread + 1)/2, se_spread = 2*sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/samplesize), spread_lower = spread - qnorm(.975)*se_spread, spread_upper = spread + qnorm(.975)*se_spread, hit = spread_lower &lt; d &amp; spread_upper &gt; d) %&gt;% select(poll_type, hit) Use brexit_hit to make a two-by-two table of poll type and hit status.
